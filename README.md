## Creating an Animation Video

After all the still frames (with the name FILENAME_###.png) are generated, I use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to compile the stills into an animation.  From the terminal run:

```ffmpeg -r 30 -i PATH_TO_FRAMES/FILENAME_%d.png -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22 -pix_fmt yuv420p -an OUTPUT_DIRECTORY/animation.mp4```

`-r 30` sets the framerate to 30 fps  
`-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 22` encodes as h.264 with better compression settings  
`-pix_fmt yuv420p` makes it compatible with the web browser  
`-an` creates a video with no audio  
You can optionally specify `-s 640x640` to control the output size of the video  
If your filename has spaces in it, you can escape them with `-i PATH_TO_FRAMES/filename\ with\ spaces_%d.png`  


## Creating an Animated GIF

I upload the resulting video or raw frames to [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) to create an animated gif.  I'm sure many other solutions exist (e.g. Photoshop, Premiere, GIMP, ffmpeg).
